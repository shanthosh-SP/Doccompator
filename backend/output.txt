The performance shown represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown above.
Principal value and investment returns will fluctuate and investors’ shares, when redeemed, may be
worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent
month-end, please visit our website at www.franklintempleton.com.
All share class returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions, including returns of capital, if
any, at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Returns have not been adjusted to
include sales charges that may apply or the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on
Fund distributions. If sales charges were reflected, the performance quoted would be lower.
Performance figures for periods shorter than one year represent cumulative figures and are not
annualized.
Fund performance figures reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which the
performance would have been lower.

    Total Annual Operating Expenses (unaudited)

As of the Fund’s current prospectus dated March 1, 2023, the gross total annual fund operating
expense ratios for Class 1, Class A, Class C, Class R, Class I and Class IS shares were 0.83%, 1.15%,
1.88%, 1.46%, 0.87% and 0.77%, respectively.
Actual expenses may be higher. For example, expenses may be higher than those shown if average
net assets decrease. Net assets are more likely to decrease and Fund expense ratios are more
likely to increase when markets are volatile.
As a result of expense limitation arrangements, the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses,
other than interest, brokerage commissions, taxes, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees
and expenses, to average net assets will not exceed 1.20% for Class A shares, 1.95% for Class C
1    Class 1 shares of the Fund are closed to all purchases or incoming exchanges. Investors owning Class 1 shares may
     continue to maintain their then-current Class 1 shares, but are no longer permitted to add to their Class 1 share
     positions, except through dividend reinvestment.

                                                                                   ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund         III

shares, 1.45% for Class R shares, 0.85% for Class I shares and 0.75% for Class IS shares. In addition,
the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class 1 shares will not exceed the ratio of total
annual fund operating expenses for Class A shares and the ratio of total annual fund operating
expenses for Class IS shares will not exceed the ratio of total annual fund operating expense for
Class I shares. Total annual fund operating expenses, after waiving fees and/or reimbursing
expenses, exceed the expense limitation (“expense cap”) for Class R, Class I and Class IS shares as
a result of acquired fund fees and expenses. These expense limitation arrangements cannot be
terminated prior to December 31, 2024 without the Board of Trustees’ consent. In addition, the
manager has agreed to waive the Fund’s management fee to an extent sufficient to offset the net
management fee payable in connection with any investment in an affiliated money market fund.
This management fee waiver is not subject to the recapture provision discussed below.
The manager is permitted to recapture amounts waived and/or reimbursed to a class during the
same fiscal year if the class’ total annual fund operating expenses have fallen to a level below the
expense cap in effect at the time the fees were earned or the expenses incurred. In no case will the
manager recapture any amount that would result, on any particular business day of the Fund, in the
class’ total annual fund operating expenses exceeding the expense cap or any other lower limit
then in effect.

As always, thank you for your confidence in our stewardship of your assets.
Sincerely,

RISKS: The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to market and price fluctuations.
Mid-cap stocks may be more volatile than large-cap stocks. International investments are
subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political
uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets.
Emerging market countries tend to have economic, political and legal systems that are less
developed and are less stable than those of more developed countries. The Fund may use
derivatives, such as options, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and
have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. The market values of securities or other
assets will fluctuate, sometimes sharply and unpredictably, due to changes in general market
conditions, overall economic trends or events, governmental actions or intervention, actions
taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks, market disruptions caused by trade
disputes or other factors, political developments, armed conflicts, economic sanctions and
countermeasures in response to sanctions, major cybersecurity events, investor sentiment, the
global and domestic effects of a pandemic, and other factors that may or may not be related to

discussion of these and other risks and the Fund’s investment strategies.
All investments are subject to risk including the possible loss of principal. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. All index performance reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes.
Please note that an investor cannot invest directly in an index.




i    The Russell Midcap Index measures the performance of the mid-cap segment of the US equity universe. The Russell
     Midcap Index is a subset of the Russell 1000 Index. It includes approximately 800 of the smallest securities based
     on a combination of their market cap and current index membership. The Russell Midcap Index represents
     approximately 27% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 1000 companies. The Russell 1000 Index
     represents approximately 93% of the U.S. equity market.

     sales charges, if any.

    arrangements, fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. In the absence of compensating balance
    arrangements, fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, the total return would have been lower. Past
    performance is no guarantee of future results.

    by the number of days in the most recent fiscal half-year (181), then divided by 365.

Notes to financial statements (unaudited)
1. Organization and significant accounting policies
ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund (the “Fund”) is a separate diversified investment series of Legg
Mason Partners Investment Trust (the “Trust”). The Trust, a Maryland statutory trust, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as an
open-end management investment company.
The Fund follows the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services –
Investment Companies (“ASC 946”). The following are significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Fund and are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), including, but not limited to, ASC 946. Estimates and
assumptions are required to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets
resulting from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in the economic
environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these
estimates could cause actual results to differ. Subsequent events have been evaluated
through the date the financial statements were issued.
(a) Investment valuation. Equity securities for which market quotations are available are
valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or
exchange on which they trade. The valuations for fixed income securities (which may
include, but are not limited to, corporate, government, municipal, mortgage-backed,
collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities) and certain derivative
instruments are typically the prices supplied by independent third party pricing services,
which may use market prices or broker/dealer quotations or a variety of valuation
techniques and methodologies. The independent third party pricing services typically use
inputs that are observable such as issuer details, interest rates, yield curves, prepayment
speeds, credit risks/spreads, default rates and quoted prices for similar securities.
Investments in open-end funds are valued at the closing net asset value per share of each
fund on the day of valuation. When the Fund holds securities or other assets that are
denominated in a foreign currency, the Fund will normally use the currency exchange rates
as of 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). If independent third party pricing services are unable to
supply prices for a portfolio investment, or if the prices supplied are deemed by the
manager to be unreliable, the market price may be determined by the manager using
quotations from one or more broker/dealers or at the transaction price if the security has
recently been purchased and no value has yet been obtained from a pricing service or
pricing broker. When reliable prices are not readily available, such as when the value of a
security has been significantly affected by events after the close of the exchange or market
on which the security is principally traded, but before the Fund calculates its net asset
value, the Fund values these securities as determined in accordance with procedures
approved by the Fund’s Board of Trustees.
Pursuant to policies adopted by the Board of Trustees, the Fund’s manager has been
designated as the valuation designee and is responsible for the oversight of the daily
valuation process. The Fund’s manager is assisted by the Global Fund Valuation Committee
(the “Valuation Committee”). The Valuation Committee is responsible for making fair value

                                           ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report   19
Notes to financial statements (unaudited) (cont’d)

determinations, evaluating the effectiveness of the Fund’s pricing policies, and reporting to
the Fund’s manager and the Board of Trustees. When determining the reliability of third
party pricing information for investments owned by the Fund, the Valuation Committee,
among other things, conducts due diligence reviews of pricing vendors, monitors the daily
change in prices and reviews transactions among market participants.
The Valuation Committee will consider pricing methodologies it deems relevant and
appropriate when making fair value determinations. Examples of possible methodologies
include, but are not limited to, multiple of earnings; discount from market of a similar freely
traded security; discounted cash-flow analysis; book value or a multiple thereof; risk
premium/yield analysis; yield to maturity; and/or fundamental investment analysis. The
Valuation Committee will also consider factors it deems relevant and appropriate in light of
the facts and circumstances. Examples of possible factors include, but are not limited to,
the type of security; the issuer’s financial statements; the purchase price of the security; the
discount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of
purchase; analysts’ research and observations from financial institutions; information
regarding any transactions or offers with respect to the security; the existence of merger
proposals or tender offers affecting the security; the price and extent of public trading in
similar securities of the issuer or comparable companies; and the existence of a shelf
registration for restricted securities.
For each portfolio security that has been fair valued pursuant to the policies adopted by the
Board of Trustees, the fair value price is compared against the last available and next
available market quotations. The Valuation Committee reviews the results of such back
testing monthly and fair valuation occurrences are reported to the Board of Trustees
quarterly.
The Fund uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that are consistent with the
market approach and/or income approach, depending on the type of security and the
particular circumstance. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. The income
approach uses valuation techniques to discount estimated future cash flows to present
value.
GAAP establishes a disclosure hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to value assets and liabilities at measurement date. These inputs are summarized in
the three broad levels listed below:
• Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical investments
• Level 2 — other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar
  investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)
• Level 3 — significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund’s own assumptions in
  determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodologies used to value securities are not necessarily an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of the inputs used in valuing the Fund’s assets carried at fair
value:

† See Schedule of Investments for additional detailed categorizations.

(b) Foreign currency translation. Investment securities and other assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts based upon
prevailing exchange rates on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of investment
securities and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S. dollar amounts based upon prevailing exchange rates on the respective dates of
such transactions.
The Fund does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from
changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.
Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign currencies,
including gains and losses on forward foreign currency contracts, currency gains or losses
realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the
difference between the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes
recorded on the Fund’s books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually
received or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in
the values of assets and liabilities, other than investments in securities, on the date of
valuation, resulting from changes in exchange rates.
Foreign security and currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not
typically associated with those of U.S. dollar denominated transactions as a result of,
among other factors, the possibility of lower levels of governmental supervision and
regulation of foreign securities markets and the possibility of political or economic
instability.
(c) Foreign investment risks. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities may involve
risks not present in domestic investments. Since securities may be denominated in foreign
currencies, may require settlement in foreign currencies or may pay interest or dividends in
foreign currencies, changes in the relationship of these foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar

                                                     ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report        21
Notes to financial statements (unaudited) (cont’d)

can significantly affect the value of the investments and earnings of the Fund. Foreign
investments may also subject the Fund to foreign government exchange restrictions,
expropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic developments, all of which
affect the market and/or credit risk of the investments.
(d) Security transactions and investment income. Security transactions are accounted
for on a trade date basis. Interest income (including interest income from payment-in-kind
securities), adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on
the accrual basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for dividends
received in cash and/or securities. Foreign dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend
date or as soon as practicable after the Fund determines the existence of a dividend
declaration after exercising reasonable due diligence. The cost of investments sold is
determined by use of the specific identification method. To the extent any issuer defaults or
a credit event occurs that impacts the issuer, the Fund may halt any additional interest
income accruals and consider the realizability of interest accrued up to the date of default
or credit event.
(e) REIT distributions. The character of distributions received from Real Estate Investment
Trusts (‘‘REITs’’) held by the Fund is generally comprised of net investment income, capital
gains, and return of capital. It is the policy of the Fund to estimate the character of
distributions received from underlying REITs based on historical data provided by the REITs.
After each calendar year end, REITs report the actual tax character of these distributions.
Differences between the estimated and actual amounts reported by the REITs are reflected
in the Fund’s records in the year in which they are reported by the REITs by adjusting related
investment cost basis, capital gains and income, as necessary.
(f) Distributions to shareholders. Distributions from net investment income and
distributions of net realized gains, if any, are declared at least annually. Distributions to
shareholders of the Fund are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
(g) Share class accounting. Investment income, common expenses and realized/
unrealized gains (losses) on investments are allocated to the various classes of the Fund on
the basis of daily net assets of each class. Fees relating to a specific class are charged
directly to that share class.
(h) Compensating balance arrangements. The Fund has an arrangement with its
custodian bank whereby a portion of the custodian’s fees is paid indirectly by credits earned
on the Fund’s cash on deposit with the bank.
(i) Federal and other taxes. It is the Fund’s policy to comply with the federal income and
excise tax requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, the Fund intends to distribute
its taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to shareholders in accordance with timing
requirements imposed by the Code. Therefore, no federal or state income tax provision is
required in the Fund’s financial statements.

22     ClearBridge Mid Cap Fund 2023 Semi-Annual Report
Management has analyzed the Fund’s tax positions taken on income tax returns for all open
tax years and has concluded that as of October 31, 2022, no provision for income tax is
required in the Fund’s financial statements. The Fund’s federal and state income and federal
excise tax returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not
expired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments
of revenue.
(j) Reclassification. GAAP requires that certain components of net assets be reclassified
to reflect permanent differences between financial and tax reporting. These
reclassifications have no effect on net assets or net asset value per share.
2. Investment management agreement and other transactions with affiliates
Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC (“LMPFA”) is the Fund’s investment manager and
ClearBridge Investments, LLC (“ClearBridge”) is the Fund’s subadviser. Western Asset
Management Company, LLC (“Western Asset”) manages the portion of the Fund’s cash and
short-term instruments allocated to it. LMPFA, ClearBridge and Western Asset are indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Franklin Resources, Inc. (“Franklin Resources”).
Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an investment management
fee, calculated daily and paid monthly, in accordance with the following breakpoint
schedule:
Average Daily Net Assets                                                            Annual Rate
First $1 billion                                                                       0.750%
Next $1 billion                                                                        0.700
Next $3 billion                                                                        0.650
Next $5 billion                                                                        0.600
Over $10 billion                                                                       0.550

LMPFA provides administrative and certain oversight services to the Fund. LMPFA delegates
to the subadviser the day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund, except for the
management of the portion of the Fund’s cash and short-term instruments allocated to
Western Asset. For its services, LMPFA pays ClearBridge a fee monthly, at an annual rate
equal to 70% of the net management fee it receives from the Fund. For Western Asset’s
services to the Fund, LMPFA pays Western Asset monthly 0.02% of the portion of the Fund’s
average daily net assets that are allocated to Western Asset by LMPFA.
As a result of expense limitation arrangements between the Fund and LMPFA, the ratio of
total annual fund operating expenses, other than interest, brokerage commissions, taxes,
extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses, to average net assets of
Class A, Class C, Class R, Class I and Class IS shares did not exceed 1.20%, 1.95%, 1.45%,
0.85% and 0.75%, respectively. In addition, the ratio of total annual fund operating
expenses for Class IS shares did not exceed the ratio of total annual fund operating
expenses for Class I shares and the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class
1 shares did not exceed the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses for Class A
shares. These expense limitation arrangements cannot be terminated prior to December 31,

2024 without the Board of Trustees’ consent. In addition, the manager has agreed to waive
the Fund’s management fee to an extent sufficient to offset the net management fee
payable in connection with any investment in an affiliated money market fund (the
“affiliated money market fund waiver”). The affiliated money market fund waiver is not
subject to the recapture provision discussed below.
During the six months ended April 30, 2023, fees waived and/or expenses reimbursed
amounted to $137,485, which included an affiliated money market fund waiver of $5,472.
LMPFA is permitted to recapture amounts waived and/or reimbursed to a class during the
same fiscal year if the class’ total annual fund operating expenses have fallen to a level
below the expense limitation (“expense cap”) in effect at the time the fees were earned or
the expenses incurred. In no case will LMPFA recapture any amount that would result, on
any particular business day of the Fund, in the class’ total annual fund operating expenses
exceeding the expense cap or any other lower limit then in effect.
Franklin Templeton Investor Services, LLC (“Investor Services”) serves as the Fund’s
shareholder servicing agent and acts as the Fund’s transfer agent and dividend-paying
agent. Investor Services is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources.
Franklin Distributors, LLC (“Franklin Distributors”) serves as the Fund’s sole and exclusive
distributor. Franklin Distributors is an indirect, wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary of
Franklin Resources.
There is a maximum initial sales charge of 5.50% for Class A shares. There is a contingent
deferred sales charge (“CDSC”) of 1.00% on Class C shares, which applies if redemption
occurs within 12 months from purchase payment. In certain cases, Class A shares have a
1.00% CDSC, which applies if redemption occurs within 18 months from purchase payment.
This CDSC only applies to those purchases of Class A shares, which, when combined with
current holdings of other shares of funds sold by Franklin Distributors, equal or exceed
$1,000,000 in the aggregate. These purchases do not incur an initial sales charge.
For the six months ended April 30, 2023, sales charges retained by and CDSCs paid to
Franklin Distributors and its affiliates, if any, were as follows:
                                                                            Class A   Class C
Sales charges                                                               $80,543      —

4. Derivative instruments and hedging activities
During the six months ended April 30, 2023, the Fund did not invest in derivative
instruments.
5. Class specific expenses, waivers and/or expense reimbursements
The Fund has adopted a Rule 12b-1 shareholder services and distribution plan and under
that plan the Fund pays service and/or distribution fees with respect to its Class A, Class C
and Class R shares calculated at the annual rate of 0.25%, 1.00% and 0.50% of the average
daily net assets of each class, respectively. Service and/or distribution fees are accrued
daily and paid monthly.
For the six months ended April 30, 2023, class specific expenses were as follows:

9. Redemption facility
The Fund, together with other U.S. registered and foreign investment funds (collectively, the
“Borrowers”) managed by Franklin Resources or its affiliates, is a borrower in a joint
syndicated senior unsecured credit facility totaling $2.675 billion (the “Global Credit
Facility”). The Global Credit Facility provides a source of funds to the Borrowers for
temporary and emergency purposes, including the ability to meet future unanticipated or
unusually large redemption requests. Unless renewed, the Global Credit Facility will
terminate on February 2, 2024.
Under the terms of the Global Credit Facility, the Fund shall, in addition to interest charged
on any borrowings made by the Fund and other costs incurred by the Fund, pay its share of
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the implementation and maintenance of the
Global Credit Facility, based upon its relative share of the aggregate net assets of all the
Borrowers, including an annual commitment fee of 0.15% based upon the unused portion of
the Global Credit Facility. These fees are reflected in the Statement of Operations. The Fund
did not utilize the Global Credit Facility during the six months ended April 30, 2023.
10. Recent accounting pronouncement
In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) – Fair Value
Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The
amendments in the ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity
security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore,
should not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, with the option of early
adoption. Management has reviewed the requirements and believes that the adoption of
the ASU will not have a material impact on the financial statements.

The conservation of energy, technology absorption, foreign exchange earnings and outgo pursuant to the provisions
of Section 134(3) (m) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014:


CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
Conservation of Electrical Power:
The Company has taken specific initiatives towards conservation of electrical energy through usage of energy efficient
equipment, substitution of electrical power for applications such as heating and usage of alternate / renewable energy.

The total renewable power consumption aggregates to 1,080.35 lakh units during the financial year 2022-2023 (1,086.80
lakhs units during the financial year 2021-2022) which represents 39.91% of total power consumption. The use of renewable
power sources has resulted in reduction of emission of Green House Gases equivalent to 875.08 MT CO2.

a. The Company also focused on energy savings at its manufacturing units through implementation of energy conservation
   initiatives / projects. The steps taken on conservation of energy are as follows:-
     1)   Onsite Solar power generation capacity has been doubled from 2.69 MWp to 5.78 MWp with an additional capacity
          commissioned in Q4 of FY 2023. This has led to the annual generation increase from 35.54 Lakh kWh units to
          40.85 Lakh kWh units. The full benefit of additional capacity will be realized in FY 2024.
     2)   Hot water circulation in heat treatment furnaces is used to wash tanks which resulted in elimination of electrical
          heaters.
     3)   Reduction in power consumption of tempering furnace process by eliminating the heat loss in hatch cooling jacket
          system.
     4)   Reduction in transformer loss by switching off 1250 KVA 11 KV/433V Transformer and shared the loads through
          Bus Coupler, which is used to couple one bus to the other without any interruption in power supply.
     5)   Power consumption of air compressors has been reduced by eliminating pneumatically operated grippers in machines.
     6)   Power consumption in Sealed Quench Furnace (SQF) process has been reduced by elimination of Endo generator.

                             FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2022-2023

1.   Brief Outline of the Company’s CSR Policy
     The Company has framed the CSR Policy pursuant to the Companies Act, 2013 and the Companies (Corporate Social
     Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014 as amended by the Companies (CSR Policy) Amendment Rules, 2021.

     Our social responsibility initiatives
     Sundram Fasteners Limited (the Company) believes that being socially responsible, delivering profitable growth and
     meeting expectations of our stakeholders is fundamental to value system the Company beholds. Further to its corporate
     social responsibility policy, the Company has been constantly creating newer opportunities for the community in which
     it operates by leveraging its resources. In such a process, the Company also collaborates with specialist organizations,
     to have a long-term positive impact in the community surrounding its operations and in remote villages. Among other
     areas, the Company has been primarily focusing on two important socially relevant themes - “education and healthcare”.
     The Company is strongly progressing in this arena and has been creating its impact on society by contributing to the
     development of the community.

     Educational initiatives
     Sundram Matriculation Higher Secondary School
     The Company set up an English medium higher secondary co-educational school in Aviyur Village in Virudhunagar
     district of Tamil Nadu about 30 years ago to provide high-quality education with modern facilities to children. The
     School is run under the CSR arm of the Company - Krishna Educational Society. The Company bears the entire cost
     of running the school. The project focuses on providing quality education to 469 students including 227 girl students
     from 8 villages near Krishnapuram plant through Sundram Matriculation Higher Secondary School.

     Primary education and higher education
     In addition to deploying its own resources, the Company has worked along with specialist Organisations to expand
     its footprint in support of a project on primary education and higher education. With a view to supporting the higher
     education of indigent students, through Sugun Thomas Foundation, the Company extended support to meritorious
     students from Chennai for their undergraduate education, which otherwise they may not be able to afford and would
     have deterred them from completing their education.
     The Company also supported the Clarke School for the Deaf, a school that aims to educate, train and rehabilitate the
     hearing impaired, intellectually challenged, deaf-blind and differently abled children to help them avail all the privileges
     that are available to the able bodied.

     Collaborating for positive impact
     The Company supported multi-disciplinary research in the area of Environmental studies, Mathematics, Marketing and
     Operations management at Krea University’s undergraduate ‘School of Business and Science’.
     The grant utilized by the faculty members have helped shape policies and drive impact through studies such as examining
     demographic, economic, and environmental relationships with Pulicat Lake to advise livelihood interventions for people
     around the landscape, advancements in the field of mathematics through research on computational aspects of pure
     mathematics and research on ring theory and aspects of the representation theory of non-commutative rings, Unique
     curriculum in Product and Brand Management course ‘En-ROADS Climate Workshop’ designed based on the simulator
     developed by Climate Interactive and MIT Management Sustainability Initiative, barriers and acceptance of screening
     for Breast and Cervical cancer in the State of Tamil Nadu.

     Support to the underprivileged and marginalized sections of the society
     Ensuring welfare of the children in need of care and protection, the Company has supported SOS Villages of India -
     Chatnath Homes, Chennai in meeting its basic requirements such as purchase of school van, bunker cot & mattress,
     water purifiers, sanitary napkin incinerator, construction and renovation of toilets, bathrooms, septic tank and children’s
     play area etc.

    Sundram Fasteners Centre for Social Action and Research was established in association with BALM to support their
    initiatives in addressing the quality deficits in human resources and services in the mental health sector for marginalized
    populations. Through education, the centre aims to tackle complex and chronic problems affecting people with mental
    health issues, with the goal of building solidarity across stakeholders to develop culturally resonant, social justice-
    oriented collaborative care models from the promotion, and prevention, to acute care and long term care. The centre
    focuses on training and capacity building of students choosing a career as a mental health professional and others
    such as community mobilisers, health care workers, policymakers etc. So far, the Centre has supported 464 students
    in masters’ and diploma education in a practice based immersive curriculum. The Centre’s success lies in student’s
    applying the values they have learnt at the Centre in day-to-day practice, as changemakers in the sector.
    Through research, the centre understands challenges and highlights levels of adherence and fidelity to internally
    developed protocols. The centre then translates findings from research and training to a wide range of social action
    and public policy initiatives that are sustained by students, volunteers, peer workers and faculty.
    The Company has also supported the creation of a mental Health Resource hub that would be a repository of case
    studies from the Global South for care coordinators working in a range of mental health settings. This will include content
    creation through teaching and research, creating policies based on the findings etc.

    Healthcare
    In view of the widespread inadequacies and inequalities in the rural areas, it is imperative to identify and assess
    development needs and initiatives required for the community that will address their needs consistently and effectively
    to ensure balanced growth. In this context, the Company has identified rural health as an important factor in rural
    development. The Company offers free of cost medical facilities to villages near its Krishnapuram plant (Aviyur,
    Virudhunagar district near the outskirts of Madurai) through its CSR arm, Krishna Educational Society thereby benefitting
    about 2,500 families through the programme. The medical centre has a dual role in providing medical care and educating
    people through training programmes on various health-related issues.
    Through Vaastu foundation, the Company provides primary medical care to people belonging to a poor community in
    eight villages in Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu. Through the East West Foundation, the Company provided eye,
    dental, and general health camps for 1000 persons of the Edaikazhinadu Town Panchayat in collaboration with nearby
    hospitals and pathology labs. With a focus on women’s health, a fortnightly Gynaecologist visit to the Foundation Clinic
    has also been started.
    The Company sponsored the treatment costs for women with breast cancer and children with cancer in collaboration
    with Cancer Hospital, Adyar, and the Ray of Light Foundation. The Company funded the treatment of needy children
    with congenital and rheumatic heart disease as well as children in need of emergency trauma care through CHIME
    foundation (MIOT Hospital). These women and children hail from poor socio-economic backgrounds and without financial
    aid, they would not have been able to access treatment.
    Apart from this, the Company also sponsors a program designed by Mithra Trust to engage in conversations around
    mental health being accessible, available and inviting to those who may need it including the queer community and
    those who have faced gender-based violence.

    Environment & Wildlife
    The Company extended its commitment towards environment and preservation of environment through projects like
    water conservation in the Arignar Anna Zoological Park (AAZP) through the construction of a retaining wall for the
    channels to carry rain water to Otteri Lake that is situated inside the zoo and is the only water resource for the zoo.
    The Company has been making a documentary to showcase the rich diversity of species and habitats that Tamil Nadu
    state holds and use this film as an opportunity to communicate key environmental issues of our times including examples
    where people continue to share space and co-exist with wildlife.

    Community Development
    The Company has helped restore Thenmelpakkam Village Lake in support of the community surrounding the factory
    premises by building a walkway to the pond, installing adequate inlets and outlets, and building earthen bunds to ensure
    good water retention. In order to prevent encroachments and other issues, a fence has been installed around the pond.
    The Company has also funded the construction of a drainage system in Pudugumudipoondi area which is frequently
    inundated during rains.

     Other social development initiatives by employees of the Company
     SFL has always been encouraging its employees to volunteer their time and effort in CSR initiatives to serve the
     disadvantaged and make a difference by volunteering at least one working day per year towards a social cause of their
     choice. The employees participate in various CSR initiatives, in the area of education, health and community outreach
     programmes initiated either by the Company or in association with other organizations and NGOs.
     Initiated in the year 2013, employees have strongly supported the CSR volunteering movement led by the motto “SFL
     and You can make a difference”. Every year, 100% of the employees participate in the monetary donation program
     towards societal needs as well as the employee-volunteering program.
     The Company will continue to strive towards its commitment to be socially responsible and provide avenues to make
     employees volunteering efforts meaningful and impactful.

 Management Discussion and Analysis – Financial Year: 2022-2023
Industry structure and developments
The year 2022 was special for India as it marked the 75th year of Independence, a momentous milestone in its
journey and became the fifth largest economy in the world. The economy has recovered from the pandemic
induced contraction and staged a broad-based recovery across sectors, positioning itself to ascend to the
pre-pandemic growth path in FY 2023. The Gross Tax Revenue registered a year-on-year growth driven by robust growth
in the direct taxes and GST collections.
India’s GDP is estimated to grow at 7% in FY 2023 and at 6% in FY 2024. Despite the global slowdown, India’s economic
growth rate is stronger than in many peer economies and reflects relatively strong domestic consumption and lesser
dependence on global demand. The Government of India’s strong infrastructure push under the Gati Shakti (National
Master Plan for Multimodal Connectivity) initiative, logistics development, and industrial corridor development will contribute
significantly to raising industrial competitiveness and boosting future growth.
In the automotive sector, the Indian Commercial Vehicle (CV) Industry is poised for a healthy growth and there will be adoption
of alternate fuel usages also. The Medium & Heavy Commercial Vehicles (M&HCV) Industry is the backbone of Indian
Economy and is undergoing technological upgradation through the implementation of Real-Time Driving Emission (RDE)
Norms from April 2023. With strong push for road infrastructure, the demand for trailers / multi-axle vehicles will increase.
The strong e-commerce industry moving to Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities will increase the demand for Light Commercial Vehicles
(LCVs). The demand for buses also improved as schools and offices have started in full swing after Covid shutdowns.
The tractor sales in India crossed the 1 million mark in FY 2023. The main growth drivers were the increased minimum
support price (MSP) that boosted the farm income and another year of above average monsoon. The Company’s presence
with almost all the players in the segment gave us a significant uptick and helped outperform the industry. The tractor market
is price sensitive, especially in the lower Horsepower (HP) segment and hence implementation of Bharat Stage 5 (BS5) will
be dependent on the response of the market. However, higher HP tractors will see its implementation. The emphasis on
infrastructure development by Government will spur the demand for Off Highway Vehicles (OHV).
The Passenger Vehicles (PVs) market has revived but the shortages of electronic components including chips are still
expected to continue this year as well. The sale of PVs clocked an all-time high sale in FY 2023. The growth was mainly
led by the Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) segment, which clocked over 2 million vehicles, and grew by over 33% over
FY 2022. The SUV segment commands a market share of over 50% in the PV segment. Many of the OEM’s have indicated
that industry growth in FY 2024 will be around 6-8%, as the base is higher. The dealer stocks of entry level PVs have
reached higher levels of 38 days and the market demand for these models is cooling off. All OEM’s are hiking production
of SUV’s. As the Company’s presence in SUV’s segment is increasing with more new parts developed over the last two
years for major OEM’s, the Company stands to benefit from this change.
The switch over to Electric Vehicles (EVs) are happening in a slow and steady phase. The cost of entry level cars is
increasing due to stringent emission and safety norms. This is triggering new launches in Utility Vehicles (UV) which will
increase the demand for fasteners.
The two wheeler (2W) segment clocked 19.5 million vehicles in FY 2023. This is however lower than the 21 million vehicles
clocked in FY 2019. The 2W segment has been hit badly over the past three years, and it is only in the current year it has
made a moderate comeback. The 2W EV segment has grown significantly at 0.7 million vehicles in FY 2023, a growth of over
188% as compared to FY 2022. As many as 85,000 electric 2W’s were sold in March 2023, and the projection for FY 2024,
is over 100% growth. The Government is incentivizing EV adoption to achieve 30% by 2030. The charging infrastructure
is seeing lots of investments to support with private and public sector companies’ participation. After the announcement of
vehicle scrappage policy, the Government has taken the lead to scrap all its vehicles beyond 15 years.
As exports are concerned, container availability has improved but with headwinds of inflation and Ukraine war, it is expected
to be a challenge. The fall in exports to a few countries has been mainly due to unfavourable forex situation. A dip witnessed
in exports is a concern, but an improvement is expected in the coming months. The Government’s push to use rupee for
trade will also aid recovery.
Indian Rupee ended above 75 levels against USD on March 31, 2022. The currency weakened significantly to end the
year on March 31, 2023 above 82 levels due to continued impact of Russia-Ukraine conflict, macroeconomic uncertainties
and increase in interest rates by US Federal Reserve from time to time in order to combat higher inflation rates resulting
in dollar outflows from the equity and bond markets. Indian rupee is expected to remain under pressure in the first half of
FY 2023-24 against the US dollar owing to the continued impact of inflation and high interest rates. The rupee is expected


36
to stabilise in the second half of FY 2023-24 once US and other economies pause the interest rate hikes and the foreign
investors start looking at emerging economies for their investment options.

Revenues
Domestic Sales:
Domestic sales of the Company increased by 22.95% from ` 2,631.22 Crores to ` 3,235.04 Crores. The increase in domestic
sales is attributable to strong demand from domestic OEMs during the financial year 2023.
The frequent raw material price increases over the past few years affected the material flow both for the vehicle manufacturers
and the component makers. In the aftermarket (Retail), the Company witnessed good surge in the order inflow for the
industrial and the auto segment for most part of the year. The steel price has reduced globally while in India, it is stable.
However, alloy elements’ cost are increasing and hence alloy steel prices are increasing but at a lower pace than previous
year (FY 2022).

Export Sales:
Despite the headwinds in global markets, Export sales has increased by 7.59% from ` 1,421.09 Crores to ` 1,528.95 Crores.

Operating Revenues:
The operating revenue of the Company was at ` 4,919.43 Crores (PY: ` 4,172.57 Crores).
Financial Performance:
Steel is one of the principal raw materials used by the company. The Company mitigates its major raw material price risks,
namely steel, through price increase realised from customers and improvement in operational efficiency. The Company’s
contracts with major OEMs have pass through arrangement for passing on the increase in raw material costs.
The Company, through procuring from cost-effective alternative sources, has managed to keep the cost of power under
control. The Company has been continuing its efforts to increase the share of renewable sources of power to support its
manufacturing processes. The manpower cost has been kept under control by optimising the deployment of manpower.
During the financial year 2022-2023, PBIDT (Profit before interest, foreign exchange fluctuation, depreciation, exceptional
income and tax) was at ` 797.58 Crores as against ` 752.18 Crores in the previous year, an increase of 6.04%.
Financing costs amounted to ` 24.63 Crores (` 13.39 Crores). The constant increase in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of
India during the year coupled with depreciating rupee has led to higher borrowing costs. The Company continues to exercise
prudence in its borrowings and management of working capital requirements.
Profit before tax was higher at ` 615.93 Crores (` 555.96 Crores). After providing for taxes, the Profit after Tax amounted
to ` 464.40 Crores (` 407.46 Crores).

Summary of Operating Results:                                                                                     ` in Crores

This is the decade of technology and in the field of Information Technology, India has become a force to reckon with globally.
Over the years, the Indian Government has introduced many initiatives to strengthen the nation’s economy. Many of the
Government’s flagship programmes, including Make in India, Start-up India, Digital India, the Smart City Mission and the
Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, are aimed at creating immense opportunities in India. In July
2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approved international trade settlements in Indian rupees (INR) in order to promote
the growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India and to support the increasing interest of the global trading
community. The Union Budget of 2023-24 has seven priorities: Infrastructure and investment, Inclusive development,
reaching the last mile, green growth, youth power, unleashing the potential and financial sector. The capital investment
outlay in the current Budget is three times the outlay in 2019-2020.
All the above measures augur well for India and the opportunities for developments galore in the wake of such initiatives.
Based on the current market conditions, the domestic equity markets could experience some volatility in the short term.
However, in the long run, the Indian equity markets are likely to remain attractive for investors due to the country’s strong
economic fundamentals and growth prospects. The rate of inflation will have a significant impact on the market as it affects
interest rates, corporate earnings, and investor sentiments. Political instability and tensions between nations can cause
market volatility and may affect investor confidence. The outcome of upcoming state elections and the general election in
2024 may have an impact on the market sentiment and the Government’s economic and investment policies. Further, any
decision by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates can impact the global economy. However, India has the strongest
growth prospects among emerging market economies and the fiscal 2024 budget is expected to support productivity and
higher growth which will be the bulwark for the economy amid the global downturn.
India’s import of crude oil from Russia have helped to manage the prices of Petrol and Diesel whose demand has touched
peaks similar to pre-covid times. However the food inflation is hitting all sections of population. The rising power costs remain
a cause for concern. Even though a normal monsoon is predicted, the El Nino factor is looming and it can affect monsoons.
The auto components industry is estimated to register growth in the range of 10-15 percent in FY 2024, with the key pillar
of this marked uptick is the sustained momentum in India’s domestic vehicle market.
The domestic market continues to register growth, be it the passenger vehicle, tractor, or commercial vehicle segments,
with the latter particularly witnessing good growth in the M&HCV category owing to the government push on infrastructure
development. Despite being a cyclical industry, the tractor segment is also holding up well for the last three years.
The rising content of electronics chips in every vehicle will lead to the unfolding of different scenarios, with the collective need
for the industry to adapt to the new dynamic. The auto component industry body is also bullish about rising investments in
the electrification space with suppliers intensifying capex towards localisation of EV-related products, as well as developing
the entire EV ecosystem. The government’s push in the form of automotive Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes to
drive Indian manufacturers towards increased localisation of advanced automotive technologies is going to boost exports
of the advanced components from India.
With push for infrastructure, the Government’s plan for modernization of Railways will give opportunities for growth. As far
as wind energy is concerned, India currently has 13.4 GW of prospective projects, which are expected to drive installations
until 2024 in the market. After 2024, fresh projects are likely to be wind-solar hybrid projects. The linking of utility-scale wind
and solar technology will be a crucial lever for volumes in 2024-25.
With world wanting to reduce its dependence on certain select economies, India is poised to offer a stable Government with
its sizeable talent pool to be the manufacturing hub of the world.

3)   Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life,
     for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
     To substitute usage of plastic packaging, the Company has introduced sustainable packaging where
     bio-degradable plastic is used as packaging material. The Company also promotes the usage of gunny bags instead
     of plastics. Consumption of virgin packaging materials like cartons and wooden pallets have been greatly reduced by
     reusing them wherever applicable across all the sites.
     Through partnerships with authorized agencies, the Company constantly strives to develop mechanisms of recycling
     and reusing hazardous waste generated across its operations. Since majority of the Company’s products are composed
     of steel, therefore the MS scrap is re-used as an input material by feeding the scrap into steel melting furnaces.

     Yes. EPR is applicable to the Company’s activities, since plastics are used in packaging materials in its products. One

9.   Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by
     your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices
     adopted to manage such wastes.
     Through partnerships with authorized agencies, the Company constantly strives to develop mechanisms of recycling and
     reusing hazardous waste generated across its operations. Since the majority of the Company’s products are composed
     of steel, the MS scrap generated is being recycled and re-used by feeding the scrap into steel melting furnaces.
     The company’s manufacturing operations have been optimized to reduce the usage of hazardous chemicals in the
     processes. Hazardous waste like chemical sludge, waste or residues containing oil are directed to cement industries
     for co-incineration as per TNPCB norms.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and
auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with
respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/
loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting


90
principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the
Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

•   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or
    error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
    appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
    higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
    or the override of internal control.

•   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
    in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether
    the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating
    effectiveness of such controls.

•   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
    disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.

•   Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of
    accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a
    material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to
    continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
    auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
    to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
    However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

•   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures,
    and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
    achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.


                                                                                                                                91
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Sundram
Fasteners Limited for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Referred to in paragraph 1 under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of
even date)

(i)    (a)   (A)   The Company has maintained proper records showing full particulars, including quantitative details and
                   situation of Property, Plant and Equipment.
             (B)   The Company has maintained proper records showing full particulars of intangible assets.
       (b)   According to the information and explanations given to us and on the basis of our examination of the records
             of the Company, the Company has a regular programme of physical verification of its Property, Plant and
             Equipment by which all property, plant and equipment are verified in a phased manner over a period of three
             years. In accordance with this programme, certain property, plant and equipment were verified during the year.
             In our opinion, this periodicity of physical verification is reasonable having regard to the size of the Company
             and the nature of its assets. No material discrepancies were noticed on such verification.
       (c)   According to the information and explanations given to us and on the basis of our examination of the records
             of the Company, the title deeds of immovable properties (other than immovable properties where the Company
             is the lessee and the lease agreements are duly executed in favour of the lessee) disclosed in the standalone
             financial statements are held in the name of the Company.
       (d)   According to the information and explanations given to us and on the basis of our examination of the records of
             the Company, the Company has not revalued its Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right-of-Use assets)
             or intangible assets or both during the year.
       (e)   According to the information and explanations given to us and on the basis of our examination of the records
             of the Company, there are no proceedings initiated or pending against the Company for holding any benami
             property under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 and rules made thereunder.

(ii)   (a)   The inventory, except goods-in-transit and stocks lying with third parties, has been physically verified by the
             management during the year.For stocks lying with third parties at the year-end, written confirmations have
             been obtained and for goods-in-transit subsequent evidence of receipts has been linked with inventory records.
             In our opinion, the frequency of such verification is reasonable and procedures and coverage as followed by
             management were appropriate. No discrepancies were noticed on verification between the physical stocks and
             the book records that were more than 10% in the aggregate of each class of inventory
       (b)   According to the information and explanations given to us and on the basis of our examination of the records
             of the Company, the Company has been sanctioned working capital limits in excess of five crore rupees, in
             aggregate, from banks or financial institutions on the basis of security of current assets. In our opinion, the
             quarterly returns or statements filed by the Company with such banks/ or financial institutions are in agreement
             with the books of account of the Company except as follows:

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with
Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

17 Provisions (Contd.)
        iii) Provident Fund
             All eligible employees of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund, a defined
             contribution plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly. The
             Company also contributes as specified under the law, in case of certain class of employees, to a provident
             fund trust set up and to respective Regional Provident Fund Commissioner. The Company’s contribution to the
             Provident Fund, where set up as a trust, is liable for future provident fund benefits to the extent of its annual
             contribution and any shortfall in fund assets based on government specified minimum rates of return relating to
             current period service and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any as an expense in the year incurred.
             In accordance with an actuarial valuation, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of
             the expected future earnings on the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual
             members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest. Such contributions made into the fund and to the
             regional provident fund commissioner during the year are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit
             and loss.
                                                                                                     As at           As at

        iv) Compensated absences
            The Company’s net obligation in respect of Compensated absences is the amount of future benefit that employees
            have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its

       The company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation
       technique:
       Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
       Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either
                directly or indirectly
       Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable

35 Financial instruments - Fair values and risk management (Contd.)
   B Accounting classification and fair values (Contd.)
       This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are
       (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the
       standalone financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the
       Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard.
                                                                   March 31, 2023                             March 31, 2022

35 Financial instruments - Fair values and risk management (Contd.)
       Financial risk management (Contd.)
       The sources of risks which the company is exposed to and their management is given below:
       a) Market risk
          Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price
          of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates,
          foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive
          instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits,
          foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings. The Company is exposed to market risk through its use of financial
          instruments and specifically to currency risk, interest rate risk and certain other price risks, which arise from both its operating
          and investing activities.

           i)   Foreign currency risk
                Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes
                in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily
                to the foreign currency borrowings, import of raw materials and spare parts, capital expenditure, export sales and the
                Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
                Currency risk (foreign exchange risk) arises on financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency, i.e.
                in a currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured. For the purpose of Ind AS, currency risk
                does not arise from financial instruments that are non-monetary items or from financial instruments denominated in the
                functional currency.
                The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions through forward contracts, for the repayment of
                short and long term borrowings and payables arsing out of procurement of raw materials and other components. When
                a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to
                match the terms of the hedged exposure.
                Where the amounts to be paid and received in a specific currency are expected to largely offset one another, no further
                hedging activity is undertaken.
                Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities which expose the Company to currency risk are disclosed
                below. The amounts shown are those reported translated at the closing rate. Unhedged foreign currency risk exposure
                at the end of the reporting period has been expressed in Rupees.

               Derivative instruments
               The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward to mitigate the risk of changes in
               exchange rates on foreign currency exposure arising from receipt of collections from export customers and repayment
               of External commercial borrowings to a foreign bank. The counterparties of these contracts are generally banks. These
               derivative financial instruments are determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting dates based on
               information obtained from respective bankers.

           ii) Interest rate risk
               Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
               changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates
               primarily to the Company’s debt obligations with floating interest rates.
               The Company constantly monitors the credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to achieve an optimal
               maturity profile and financing cost. The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of
               fixed and variable rate borrowings. The Company has Nil% (March 31, 2022: 15%) of its borrowings at a fixed rate of
               interest.

               Interest rate sensitivity
               The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of +/-
               1% for the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible
               based on observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change in the average market
               interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in
               interest rates. All other variables are held constant.
                                                                                                           As at                    As at

               Increase                                                               +1%                    (4.36)                 (3.91)

               The Company does not expect any change in interest rates on fixed rate borrowings and accordingly have not presented
               any sensitivities on such borrowings.The Company also does not expect any significant impact of changes in the market
               interest rates on account of COVID-19.

               Equity price risk
               The Company has invested in listed and unlisted equity instruments. All investments in equity portfolio are reviewed and
               approved by the Board of Directors.
               At the reporting date, the exposure to listed equity securities at fair value was ` 20.58 (March 31, 2022: ` 18.76)

       b) Credit risk
           Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract,
           leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables)
           and from its financing activities, including, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
           Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness
           of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an
           allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of the Company’s trade
           receivables, certain loans and advances and other financial assets. The Company enters into long term contracts with its
           customers whereby it mitigates the risk exposure on high risk customers. Further, none of the customers contributes to more
           than 10% of the Company’s total revenues as continuous efforts are made in expanding its customer base. Outstanding
           customer receivables are regularly monitored and reviewed by the Audit committee periodically.

           (i) Trade receivables
               The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However,
               management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk
               associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers
               are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including end-user customers, their geographic location, industry,
               trading history with the Company and existence of previous financial difficulties. With respect to other financial
               assets, the Company does not expect any credit risk against such assets except as already assessed. The Company
               is monitoring the economic environment in the country and is taking actions to limit its exposure to customers with
               customers experiencing particular economic volatility.
               Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the Company to determine
               incurred and expected credit losses. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant
               credit losses. The Company has adopted a practical measure of computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade
               receivable and other financial assets, which comprise large number of small balances, based on a provision matrix.
               The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking information
               including consideration for increased likelihood of credit risk. Further, the Company also makes an allowance for doubtful
               debts on a case to case basis.
               The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables are as follows:
                                                                                                         As at                    As at

           (ii) Investments
               Investments of surplus funds are made only with approval of Board of Directors. Investments primarily
               include investments in equity instruments of various listed entities, power generation companies, compulsorily
               convertible preference shares and other trade investments. The Company does not expect significant credit
               risks arising from these investments after considering impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

       c) Liquidity risk
          Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at reasonable
          price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability
          of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The Company’s treasury team is
          responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks
          are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company’s liquidity position through rolling forecasts on
          the basis of expected cash flows.
          The Company’s objective is to maintain a current ratio with an optimal mix of short term loans and long term loans. The
          Company assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. The Company
          has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months and the management is confident
          that it can roll over its debt with existing lenders. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the Company’s business
          requirements vis-a-vis the source of funding.

   (i) The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its ruling dated February 28, 2019 held that the allowances paid to employees are
       essentially a part of the basic wage, which are necessarily and ordinarily paid to all employees and are to be treated
       as wages for the purpose of ‘(PF)’ Provident Fund contribution, with fewer exception to the same. With respect
       to a demand of ` 1.63 pertaining to the period March 2011 to December 2013 raised earlier by PF authorities,
       a provision has been made, however writ petition/appeal has been filed by the Company challenging the same
       and pending before Tribunal. Based on legal advice, considering that the PF authorities has not commenced any
       proceedings claiming contribution on allowances for prior or subsequent periods and considering interpretative
       challenges surrounding the retrospective application of the judgement and absence of reliable measurement of
       provisions relating to earlier periods, this matter has been disclosed as a contingent liability.
   (ii) In addition to the above, the Company from time to time is also engaged in proceedings pending with various
        authorities in the ordinary course of business. Judgement is required in assessing the range of possible outcomes
        for some of these matters, which could change substantially over time as each of the matters progresses depending
        on experience on actual assessment proceedings by the respective authorities and other judicial precedents. Based
        on its internal assessment supported by external legal counsel views, as considered necessary, the Company
        believes that it will be able to sustain its positions if challenged by the authorities and accordingly no additional
        provision / disclosures are required for these matters.
        Management is of the view that above matters will not have any material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
        position and results of operations.

manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India,
of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2023, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive
income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act.
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements
that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of
reports of the other auditors referred to in the “Other Matters” section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the consideration of reports of other
auditor on separate financial statements of components audited by them, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion
on these matters.

 Taxation and contingent liability related matters

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other
information comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial
statements and auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have
performed and based on the work done/audit reports of other auditors, we conclude that there is a material misstatement
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated
state of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and Board
of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting
frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant
to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the
consolidated financial statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies
included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing,
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective
Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to
do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial
reporting process of each company.



                                                                                                                                     167
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
•   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
    or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
    and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
    fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
    misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
    in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether
    the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating
    effectiveness of such controls.
•   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
    disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
•   Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of
    accounting in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a
    material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this
    assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
    to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
    opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,
    future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
•   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
    disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a
    manner that achieves fair presentation.
•   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements of such entities or business activity/
    activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for
    the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the
    consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the
    consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible
    for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our
    audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in the section titled “Other Matters” in this audit
    report.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the
consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such
communication.

Other matters
We did not audit the financial statements of nine subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets (before
consolidation adjustments) of ` 855.98 crores as at March 31, 2023, total revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of
Rs. 580.28 crores and net cash flows (before consolidation adjustments) amounting to ` 3.58 crores for the year ended
on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements have been audited by
other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report

               companies to or in any other person(s) or entity(ies), including foreign entities (“Intermediaries”), with the
               understanding, whether recorded in writing or otherwise, that the Intermediary shall directly or indirectly lend
               or invest in other persons or entities identified in any manner whatsoever by or on behalf of the Holding
               Company or any of such subsidiary companies (“Ultimate Beneficiaries”) or provide any guarantee, security
               or the like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries.
           (ii) The management of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies incorporated in India whose financial
                statements have been audited under the Act have represented to us and the other auditors of such subsidiary
                companies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, as disclosed in the Note 32 to the consolidated financial
                statements, no funds have been received by the Holding Company or any of such subsidiary companies from
                any person(s) or entity(ies), including foreign entities (“Funding Parties”), with the understanding, whether
                recorded in writing or otherwise, that the Holding Company or any of such subsidiary companies shall directly

      e.   The first interim dividend declared and paid by the Holding Company and dividend declared and paid by its

17 Provisions (Contd.)
       iii) Provident fund
            All eligible employees of the Group are entitled to receive benefits under provident fund, a defined contribution
            plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly. The Group also
            contributes as specified under the law, in case of certain class of employees, to a provident fund trust set up
            and to respective Regional Provident Fund Commissioner. The contribution to Provident Fund, where set up
            as a trust, is liable for future provident fund benefits to the extent of its annual contribution and any shortfall
            in fund assets based on government specified minimum rates of return relating to current period service and
            recognizes such contributions and shortfall, if any as an expense in the year incurred. In accordance with
            an actuarial valuation, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future
            earnings on the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the
            expected guaranteed rate of interest. Such contributions made into the fund and to the regional provident fund
            commissioner during the year are recognized as an expense in the statement of profit and loss.

                                                                                                    As at                As at

       iv) Compensated absences
           The Group’s net obligation in respect of compensated absences is the amount of future benefit that employees
           have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
           present value, and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The obligation is measured on the basis of
           an annual independent actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.

   Fair value measurement hierarchy
   The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation
   technique:
   Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
   Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable,
   either directly or indirectly
   Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on
   observable market data

     management framework. The board of directors along with the top management are responsible for developing and
     monitoring the Group’s risk management policies. The Group’s senior management advises on financial risks and the
     appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group.
     The Group’s risk management policies established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set
     appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management systems are

35 Financial instruments - fair values and risk management (Contd.)
   The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management focuses on
   the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance
   of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge
   foreign currency risk exposure. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative
   instruments.
   The sources of risks which the Group is exposed to and their management are given below:
a) Market risk
   Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price
   of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates,
   foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk
   sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments
   and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings. The Group is exposed to market risk through its
   use of financial instruments and specifically to currency risk, interest rate risk and certain other price risks, which result
   from both its operating and investing activities.
   i) Foreign currency risk
   Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes
   in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily
   to the foreign currency borrowings, import of raw materials and spare parts, capital expenditure, export sales and the
   Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
   Currency risk (or foreign exchange risk) arises on financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency, i.e.
   in a currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured. For the purpose of Ind AS, currency risk
   does not arise from financial instruments that are non-monetary items or from financial instruments denominated in the
   functional currency.
   The Group manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions through forward contracts, for the repayment of
   short and long term borrowings and payables arising out of procurement of raw materials and other components. When
   a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Group negotiates the terms of those derivatives to
   match the terms of the hedged exposure.
   Where the amounts to be paid and received in a specific currency are expected to largely offset one another, no further
   hedging activity is undertaken.
   Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities which expose the Group to currency risk are disclosed
   below. The amounts shown are those reported to key management translated at the closing rate. Unhedged foreign
   currency risk exposure at the end of the reporting year has been expressed in Rupees.

   Foreign currency sensitivity
   The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity with respect to the Group’s financial assets and financial
   liabilities in relation to the fluctuation in the respective currency with ‘all other things being equal’. If the Indian Rupee
   had strengthened/weakened against respective currencies by 5% and GBP or USD by 5% during the year ended
   March 31, 2023 (March 31, 2022: 5%), then this would have had the following impact on profit before tax and equity:

   Derivative instruments
   The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward to mitigate the risk of changes in
   exchange rates on foreign currency exposure arising from receipt of collections from export customers and repayment
   of External Commercial Borrowings to a foreign bank. The counterparties of these contracts are generally banks. These
   derivative financial instruments are determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting dates based on
   information obtained from respective bankers.

   ii) Interest rate risk
   Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
   changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily
   to the Group’s debt obligations with floating interest rates.
   The Group constantly monitors the credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to achieve an optimal maturity
   profile and financing cost. The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable
   rate borrowings. As at March 31, 2023, approximately 2% (March 31, 2022: 12%) of the Group’s borrowings are at a
   fixed rate of interest.

   Interest rate sensitivity
   The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of +/-
   1% for the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible
   based on observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change in the average market
   interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in
   interest rates. All other variables are held constant.
                                                                                                       As at            As at

   The Group does not expect any change in interest rates on fixed rate borrowings and accordingly have not presented
   any sensitivities on such borrowings. The Group does not expect any significant impact of changes in the market
   interest rates on account of COVID-19.
   iii) Equity price risk
   The Group invests in listed and unlisted equity instruments. All investments in equity portfolio are reviewed and
   approved by the board of directors.
   As at the reporting date, the exposure to listed equity securities at fair value was ` 24.52 (March 31, 2022: ` 22.30).
b) Credit risk
   Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract,
   leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables)
   and from its financing activities, including, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
   Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit
   worthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Group establishes
   an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of the Group’s
   trade receivables, certain loans and advances and other financial assets. The Group enters into long term contracts
   with its customers whereby it mitigates the risk exposure on high risk customers. Further, none of the customers
   contributes to more than 10% of the Group’s total revenues as continuous efforts are made in expanding its customer
   base. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and reviewed by the Audit committee periodically.
   The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

35 Financial instruments - fair values and risk management (Contd.)
   (i) Trade receivables (including unbilled revenue)
   The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However,
   management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default
   risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers
   are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including end-user customers, their geographic location, industry,
   trading history with the Group and existence of previous financial difficulties. With respect to other financial assets,
   the Group does not expect any credit risk against such assets except as already assessed. The Group is monitoring
   the economic environment in the country and is taking actions to limit its exposure to customers with customers
   experiencing particular economic volatility.
   Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the Group to determine
   incurred and expected credit losses. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant
   credit losses. The Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade
   receivable and other financial assets, which comprise large number of small balances, based on a provision matrix.
   The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking information
   including considerations for the likelihood of increased credit risk and consequential default on account of the emerging
   situations due to COVID-19. Further, the Group also makes an allowance for doubtful debts on a case to case basis.
   The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables (including unbilled revenue) are as follows:
                                                                                               As at                  As at

   The Group management also assesses the credit losses on account of the financial guarantees extended by the Group.
   The Group management evaluates the credit risk associated with these companies, ability of them to repay the debts
   and probable exposure of the Company in case a group company fails to make payment when due in accordance with
   the original or modified terms of a debt instrument of such Group Company.
   (ii) Investments
   Investments of surplus funds are made only with approval of Board of Directors. This primarily include investments in

   and other trade investments. The Group does not expect significant credit risks arising from these investments after
   considering impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

c) Liquidity risk
   Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at reasonable
   price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability
   of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The Group’s treasury team is
   responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such
   risks are overseen by senior management. Group management monitors the liquidity position of the Group through
   rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.
   The Group’s objective is to maintain a current ratio with an optimal mix of short term loans and long term loans. The
   Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. The Group
   has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months and the management is
   confident that it can roll over its debts with existing lenders. The board of directors periodically reviews the Group’s
   business requirements vis-a-vis the source of funding.

     (i) The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its ruling dated February 28, 2019 held that the allowances paid to employees are
         essentially a part of the basic wage, which are necessarily and ordinarily paid to all employees and are to be treated
         as wages for the purpose of (‘PF’) Provident Fund contribution, with fewer exception to the same. With respect
         to a demand of `1.63 pertaining to the period March 2011 to December 2013 raised earlier by PF authorities, a
         provision has been made, however writ petition/appeal has been filed by the Group challenging the same and
         pending before Tribunal. Based on legal advice, considering that the PF authorities have not commenced any
         proceedings claiming contribution on allowances for prior or subsequent periods and considering interpretative
         challenges surrounding the retrospective application of the judgement and absence of reliable measurement of
         provisions relating to earlier periods, this matter has been disclosed by the Group as a contingent liability.
     (ii) In addition to the above, the Group from time to time is also engaged in proceedings pending with various authorities
          in the ordinary course of business. Judgement is required in assessing the range of possible outcomes for some
          of these matters, which could change substantially over time as each of the matters progresses depending on
          experience on actual assessment proceedings by the respective authorities and other judicial precedents. Based
          on its internal assessment supported by external legal counsel views, as considered necessary, the Group believes
          that it will be able to sustain its positions if challenged by the authorities and accordingly no additional provision /
          disclosures are required for these matters.
         Management is of the view that above matters will not have any material adverse effect on the Group financial
         position and results of operations.

    of tax expense and that of provision for taxation.

The Company’s overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the company. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure.

The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings. The Company is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to currency risk, interest rate risk and certain other price risks, which arise from both its operating and investing activities.

The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign currency borrowings, import of raw materials and spare parts, capital expenditure, export sales and the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

For the purpose of Ind AS, currency risk does not arise from financial instruments that are non-monetary items or from financial instruments denominated in the functional currency.

When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.

These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All other variables are held constant.

The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of the Company’s trade receivables, certain loans and advances and other financial assets. The Company enters into long term contracts with its customers whereby it mitigates the risk exposure on high risk customers. Further, none of the customers contributes to more than 10% of the Company's total revenues as continuous efforts are made in expanding its customer base.

However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including end-user customers, their geographic location, industry, trading history with the Company and existence of previous financial difficulties. With respect to other financial assets, the Company does not expect any credit risk against such assets except as already assessed. The Company is monitoring the economic environment in the country and is taking actions to limit its exposure to customers with customers experiencing particular economic volatility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the Company  to determine incurred and expected credit losses. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant credit losses. The Company has adopted a practical measure of computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivable and other financial assets, which comprise large number of small balances,  based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking information including consideration for increased likelihood of credit risk. Further, the Company also makes an allowance for doubtful debts on a case to case basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. The Company enters into long term contracts with its customers whereby it mitigates the risk exposure on high risk customers. Further, none of the customers forms more than 15%-20% of the total company's revenues as the Company makes a continuous effort in expanding its customer base. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and reviewed by the Board of Directors periodically. At 31 March 2018, the top 15 customers  accounted for approximately 62% of all the receivables outstanding. At 31 March, the Company has certain trade receivables that have not been settled by the contractual due date but are not considered to be impaired. The amounts at 31 March, analysed by the length of time past due, are:

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The Company’s treasury team is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company’s liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.

                                                                                                  (i) The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its ruling dated February 28, 2019 held that the allowances paid to employees are essentially a part of the basic wage, which are necessarily and ordinarily paid to all employees and are to be treated as wages for the purpose of '(PF)' Provident Fund contribution, with fewer exception to the same. With respect to a demand of Rs.1.63 pertaining to the period March 2011 to December 2013 raised earlier by PF authorities, a provision has been made, however writ petition/appeal has been filed by the Company challenging the same and pending before Tribunal. Based on legal advice, considering that the PF authorities has not commenced any proceedings claiming contribution on allowances for prior or subsequent periods and considering interpretative challenges surrounding the retrospective application of the judgement and absence of reliable measurement of provisions relating to earlier periods, this matter has been disclosed as a contingent liability.

Judgement is required in assessing the range of possible outcomes for some of these matters, which could change substantially over time as each of the matters progresses depending on experience on actual assessment proceedings by the respective authorities and other judicial precedents. Based on its internal assessment supported by external legal counsel views, as considered necessary, the Company believes that it will be able to sustain its positions if challenged by the authorities and accordingly no additional provision / disclosures are required for these matters.\n\nManagement is of the view that above matters will not have any material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.
